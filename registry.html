      Welcome to our wedding registry! Having you celebrate with us is truly the best gift we could ask for. 
	  If you'd like to give a little something extra, we're registered at Amazon—but please know it's totally optional. 
	  Thank you so much for being part of our special day—we appreciate you more than words can say!
